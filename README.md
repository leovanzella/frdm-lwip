This project is a imlementation of the Freescale [freedom board](https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-based-processors-and-mcus/kinetis-cortex-m-mcus/l-seriesultra-low-powerm0-plus/freedom-development-platform-for-kinetis-kl14-kl15-kl24-kl25-mcus:FRDM-KL25Z)
FRDM-KL25Z and a [ENC28J60](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/en022889) Ethernet Driver.

The implementation do not uses RTOS, so it' just baremetal. Great for learning about drivers with cheap boards.
